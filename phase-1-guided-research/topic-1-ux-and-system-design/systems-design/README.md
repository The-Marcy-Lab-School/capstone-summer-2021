# Systems Design: Guided Research
## Topics & Due Dates
For the last week of our guided research period, we will be "book clubbing" _Web Scalability for Startup Engineers_ by Artur Ejsmont. We will go chapter-by-chapter, exploring the fundamental concepts and the modern tools that engineers are using today to build scalable applications.

For each book topic, you will supplement your reading by referencing any articles online (many of the book's references are listed in the appendix) _and_ by attempting to implement or experiment with the solutions that the book references, when possible. As mentioned, you will submit a blog post at the end of each study period.
